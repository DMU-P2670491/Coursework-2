  <h3>Method:</h3>
  <p>1. Place the cashew nuts in a bowl, cover with cold water, then set aside to soak for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.</p>
  <p>2. Grease a 20cm springform cake tin with margarine, sprinkle in the desiccated coconut, then give the tin a good shake so that it's evenly distributed.</p>
  <p>3. Place the dates in a bowl, cover with warm water, then leave to soak for around 10 minutes, or until softened. Drain and add to a food processor, then blitz to a rough paste. Add the almonds and hazelnuts, then blitz to a chunky crumb consistency. Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake tin, patting and smoothing it out evenly with wet hands.</p>
  <p>4. Drain and add the cashew nuts along with lemon juice, honey and coconut oil. Scrape out the seeds from vanilla pods, then add to the processor, discarding the pods. Blitz until smooth and combined, then have a taste and add more honey if you think it needs it.</p>
  <p>5. Carefully pour the cashew mixture on top of the crumb base, smoothing it out evenly. Place the tin onto a tray, then gently tap it on a work surface to get rid of any bubbles. Pop in the freezer for around 2 hours, or until set.</p>
  <p>6. Meanwhile, make the strawberry drizzle. Hull and roughly chop the strawberries, then place into a bowl with the sugar and lemon juice. Leave for around 5 minutes to soak, then place in a liquidiser and blitz until smooth.</p>

  <h3>Method:</h3>
  <p>1. Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6 and grease a baking sheet.</p>
  <p>2. For the choux pastry, melt the butter in a saucepan with 220ml of water then bring to a rolling boil.</p>
  <p>3. Sift the flour and 1 pinch of fine sea salt onto a piece of folded greaseproof paper, then quickly pour into the boiling water.</p>
  <p>4. Beat the pastry mixture vigorously with a wooden spoon until it’s smooth and the bottom of the pan is beginning to fur, then spread out on a plate and leave to cool for 20 minutes.</p>
  <p>5. Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Crush the pistachios. Place the cream and most of the pistachios in a small saucepan and slowly bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and leave to infuse until ready to use.</p>
  <p>6. Beat the eggs. Once the pastry is cool, return it to the saucepan and gradually beat in the beaten egg until the pastry mixture reaches a consistency that lazily drops off the spoon (you may not need all of the beaten egg).</p>
  <p>7. Using teaspoons, space out small dollops of pastry mixture on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>
  <p>8. Once cooked, use a skewer or drinking straw to pierce holes in the bases of the profiteroles, then leave them upside down on a wire rack to dry completely.</p>
  <p>9. When you’re ready to fill the profiteroles, strain the cream and discard the pistachios. Whip the cream with the icing sugar and vanilla essence until it holds its shape. Transfer to a piping bag and pipe a teaspoonful or so into the centre of each profiterole.</p>
  <p>10. Break the chocolate into bites, then melt in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water (without letting the bowl touch the water).</p>
  <p>11. Arrange the profiteroles on a platter and drizzle over some of the melted chocolate. Serve the leftover chocolate in a small jug on the side.</p>
